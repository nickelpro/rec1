C 2018 6.2.5.1

The meaning of a value stored in an object or returned by a function is
determined by the type of the expression used to access it. (An identifier
declared to be an object is the simplest such expression; the type is specified
in the declaration of the identifier.) Types are partitioned into object types
(types that describe objects) and function types (types that describe
functions). At various points within a translation unit an object type may be
incomplete (lacking sufficient information to determine the size of objects of
that type) or complete (having sufficient information).

/*
C 2018 6.2.5.4

There are five standard signed integer types, designated as signed char, short
int, int, long int, and long long int.

C 2018 6.2.5.6

For each of the signed integer types, there is a corresponding (but different)
unsigned integer type (designated with the keyword unsigned) that uses the same
amount of storage (including sign information)

/*
C 2018 6.2.5.3

An object declared as type char is large enough to store any member of the
basic execution character set. If a member of the basic execution character set
is stored in a char object, its value is guaranteed to be nonnegative. If any
other character is stored in a char object, the resulting value is
implementation-defined but shall be within the range of values that can be
represented in that type.

/*
C 2018 6.3.2.1.2

Except when it is the operand of the sizeof operator, or the unary & operator,
or is a string literal used to initialize an array, an expression that has type
“array of type” is converted to an expression with type “pointer to type” that
points to the initial element of the array object and is not an lvalue.
